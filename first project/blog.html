            <b>1905 - </b> At least Juventus now have a win to their name. A 3-2 victory over Spezia moved Juventus up to the giddy heights of 13th in the Serie A table,
             the gap to leaders Inter Milan eight points with five games played so far in the new Italian season.

            An ignominious place in Juventus' history was just about avoided -- only the team of 1955-56 had gone five games winless to start a new season, ending it in ninth --

            Had Manuel Locatelli not blocked Janis Antiste's shot off the line with Spezia 2-1 up, he might not have found it so easy to make merry about his side's lowly standing in Italy.
